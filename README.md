## Description
Students (or novices) will likely encounter coding assessments during their employment search for jobs within the web development field. These coding assessments can include a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. This application was built to assist these individuals by increasing not only their knowledge of JavaScript but also their confidence levels. To keep it interesting, there are a few outdated topics for those just-in-case moments. 

Players will answer as many questions as possible within a 60 second time interval. Incorrect answers will decrease the players score by ten and correct answers will increase the score by ten. Each player begins with a score of zero, each question is worth 10 points. The quiz currently contains 70 questions, so the highest attainable score is 700. Please note the application will randomly select questions to avoid encountering the same sequence of questions each time. The quiz ends when time runs out. A player's score is tracked and displayed as is their question count. The player is able to enter their initials, saving their score and date/time played to the Leader Board as well as view the Leader Board/High Scores screen.

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

It is important to note that questions/answers were derived from various sources with majority coming from [JavaScript Multiple Choice Questions and Answers](#credits) blog. In addition, various material was reviewed regarding coding strategies and ideas, including but not limited to [*Build A Quiz App With Javascript (Plus ES6 Classes)*](#credits) and [*How to Pick a Random Element from an Array in Javascript*](#credits).
